# Open Apply

> Autonomous job search agent. Runs 100% locally. Your CV never leaves your machine.

Open Apply is an open-source, privacy-first, terminal-first job application assistant.
It helps you discover roles, score fit, tailor ATS-safe CVs, and draft applications with Human In The Loop controls.

## Why

career-ops showed the world this is possible.
Open Apply makes it accessible to everyone:

- No paid cloud AI subscription requirement
- No cloud API key requirement
- No vendor lock-in
- Full local control over data and models

## What It Does

Open Apply is designed as an end-to-end local pipeline:

1. Job discovery across configured portals
- scans active portals and discovers new listings
- deduplicates against existing DB records and scan history

2. 10-dimension fit evaluation
- scores each role from 1.0 to 5.0 across role, skills, seniority, compensation, geo, stage, PMF, growth, interview likelihood, and timeline
- computes weighted score + grade (A/B/C/D/F)
- writes a markdown report to reports/

3. Tailored ATS CV generation
- extracts high-value JD keywords
- reorders bullets by relevance (without deleting user content)
- renders ATS-safe HTML to PDF via Playwright
- saves artifacts to output/ and metadata to DB

4. Human-reviewed application drafting
- opens and drafts common form fields
- never auto-submits
- requires explicit human review before marking as applied

5. Parallel batch processing
- processes queued URLs concurrently
- fault tolerant: one failure does not block the queue
- resumable behavior for previously processed jobs

6. Outcome learning loop
- logs interview/rejection/offer/ghosted outcomes
- adjusts scoring weights in DB based on feedback patterns

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install openapply
openapply setup
```

Then:

```bash
openapply scan
```

## Philosophy

AI analyzes. You decide. HITL always.

Open Apply intentionally avoids full autonomy on final submission actions.
The system can evaluate, draft, and prefill, but a human must review before applying.

## Core Commands

```bash
openapply setup
openapply scan
openapply scan --auto
openapply batch --min-score B --limit 20
openapply apply <url-or-jd-text>
openapply tracker
openapply learn <job-id> <outcome>
```

## Models

Open Apply uses local Ollama models. A practical starting setup:

- `llama3.1:8b` for evaluation
	- Pros: fast, low hardware footprint, good for scoring and routing
	- Tradeoff: less nuanced generation quality for long-form text

- `qwen2.5:14b` for generation
	- Pros: stronger CV/cover-letter drafting quality
	- Tradeoff: slower and heavier resource usage

General guidance:

- Use smaller models for high-volume scan/eval loops.
- Use larger models for final artifact generation quality.
- Keep all inference local through Ollama.

## Local-First Privacy

- CV, config, reports, and generated files are stored locally.
- SQLite DB runs locally (`data/openapply.db`).
- Prompt and model execution are local-first by design.

## Project Status

Open Apply is in active development (`0.1.0`) and currently optimized for terminal workflows.
Web UI support is planned as secondary priority.

## Documentation

- docs/SETUP.md

## Inspiration

Inspired by the ideas popularized in career-ops (MIT), including structured fit scoring, CV templating workflow, and portal scanning patterns.
Open Apply is implemented from scratch as a standalone Python product.
